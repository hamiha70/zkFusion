# 1inch Protocol Integration Rules - VALIDATION PHASE

## CURRENT PRIORITY: Reality Check & Validation
- FIRST: Compare our interfaces with docs_external/1inch/limit-order-protocol/contracts/interfaces/
- VALIDATE: Order struct compatibility with LOP v4 (real address: 0x111111125421ca6dc452d289314280a0f8842a65)
- TEST: SDK usage without API calls (hackathon constraint)
- VERIFY: Extension pattern alignment for zkFusion auction integration

## Integration Guidelines
- Use @1inch/limit-order-protocol-utils for order creation
- Always validate order signatures before submission
- Handle partial fills in limit orders
- Use proper nonce management for orders
- Include maker/taker asset addresses validation
- Test with mock LOP contracts first, then validate against real deployments
- Reference docs_external/1inch/limit-order-protocol/contracts/ for interfaces
- Use docs_external/1inch/fusion-sdk/ for advanced features
- Check docs_external/tutorials/defi-integration/ for examples

## Pre-Office Hour Validation Checklist
- [ ] Interface compatibility confirmed
- [ ] Extension pattern validated
- [ ] SDK integration approach confirmed
- [ ] Testnet deployment addresses identified
